 We are going to change the world!

 Over the past few months we have developed kits that kids can put together to make robots do their chores! Why would we want to make kids lazy? We don't, and we actually believe that this project will educate kids and the next generation in robots, stem, and programming. Here is an example of one of our many kits. We have developed a robot that can built in 1-2 hours and programmed in less than 30 minutes to take the garbage cans to the road every week!!! Yes, we are conquering the world of chores! We call this amazing bot,"chorebot.Mach1," and yes, it is mach1 mach2 is being developed and will likey be attacheable to all garbage cans and or lawnmowers or vacuums. When we partner with kids we will automate the world!
